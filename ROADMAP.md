# Harkonnen Labs — Execution Roadmap

**This is the canonical build order from 2026-04-17 forward.**
Phases 1, 4, 4b, 5, v1 (A-D), and 2 are shipped. Phase 3 remains the active
build target, with live twin provisioning explicitly deferred unless a future
product needs running service virtualization.

---

## Maturity Ladder

This roadmap is the canonical build sequence from today's factory state to true Phase 4 agentic intelligence and beyond.

| Maturity phase | Meaning | Harkonnen status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 — Assisted Intelligence | Copilots, chatbots, drafting help | Already surpassed |
| Phase 2 — Automated Intelligence | Rule-based workflows, permissions, governance | Already surpassed as a standalone destination |
| Phase 3 — Augmented Intelligence | Core agent with proactive suggestions, learning loops, human confidence-building | Current baseline |
| Phase 4 — Agentic Intelligence | Self-directed agents inside explicit guardrails, with structural coordination and self-monitoring | Active destination — Phase v1 closes the remaining gap |

### What still separates Harkonnen from Phase 4 (verified in source, 2026-04-18)

A structured gap analysis identified seven practical gaps. Gap-closure phases A–D addressed five of them. Three structural gaps remain before the system can legitimately claim Tier 4:

| Gap | Gap-closure status |
| --- | --- |
| Enforced authority and guardrail boundaries | **Open** — `check_lease` API exists but is never called pre-write; guardrails are advisory only |
| Live world-state modeling | Deferred — twin is still a manifest; live provisioning is postponed until a product needs running service virtualization |
| Closed-loop outcome verification | Partial — observation endpoint deferred to Phase E (TypeDB dependency) |
| Structural multi-agent coordination | Mostly closed — blackboard, heartbeat, claim eviction are real |
| Economic and cost awareness | Closed — A1 trace spine + cost events |
| Explicit intent → plan → execution separation | Closed — B, C (OptimizationProgram) |
| External system interfaces | Open — Phase v1 External Integrations track |

### How this roadmap closes that gap

- `.harkonnen/gap-closure-progress.md` tracks strategic bridge work phases A–D (all shipped)
- Phase v1 (below) is the structural gate before the factory can be called Tier 4
- Phase E remains deferred on the TypeDB-backed state graph
- Numbered execution phases (2-7) stay focused on factory capability: real test execution, run-quality benchmarks, lifecycle adapters, memory infrastructure, TypeDB, causal corpus
- Operator Model Activation and External Integrations are parallel product tracks

## Why this order

The factory has a complete foundation: core pipeline, PackChat control plane, layered Coobie memory, causal graph, Pearl hierarchy labeling, multi-hop retrieval, operator-reviewed consolidation Workbench, agent trace spine, optimization programs, and adversarial metric attacks. The remaining gaps before Tier 4 are concrete and bounded: guardrails are advisory instead of enforced, the memory invalidation persistence layer is incomplete, and there are no outbound integrations. Phase v1 closes those gaps. After that, Phase 2 makes Bramble's validation score meaningful and Phase 3 focuses on documentation quality, spec-grounded evaluation, and lifecycle benchmark readiness. Live twin work remains available to revisit later if a product truly needs it.

Benchmarking remains a parallel track. Each phase ships with at least one measurable gate.
The benchmark philosophy should remain explicitly agentic-engineering shaped:
measure how quickly and safely software moves through the delivery system, not
just how quickly code is emitted. That means coordination compression, downstream
validation speed, and time-to-root-cause matter alongside code-level success.

---

## Phase v1 — Tier 4 Finalization

**This is the active build target.** Closes the remaining structural gaps that prevent Harkonnen from being called a genuine Tier 4 agentic workflow. Phases 2 and 3 begin after this phase is done.

### v1-A — Guardrail Enforcement (hard blocker for Tier 4)

**Why it's a blocker:** Tier 4 requires agents to operate *inside* explicit guardrails, not just record them. Currently `check_lease` exists in `src/api.rs` but is never called from `src/orchestrator.rs`. Every Mason file write bypasses the lease system. Decision records are written *after* the fact, not enforced *before* the act.

**What to build:**

- Call `POST /api/coordination/check-lease` inside `mason_generate_and_apply_edits` before writing any file — pass `resource_kind: "workspace"`, the staged path prefix, and the run's guardrails from the Coobie briefing. If the response is denied or returns violations, return an error rather than proceeding and write a decision record explaining why the write was blocked.
- Wire the same check in the Mason plan generation path: claim `resource_kind: "workspace"` at plan start with `ttl_secs` derived from the spec's time budget
- Add at least three more `record_decision` call sites: Mason plan selection, Scout optimization program derivation, Sable attack generation. Currently only Coobie critique and consolidation promotion are wired.
- Add `GET /api/runs/:id/decisions` to the Pack Board run detail drawer so operators can inspect the decision audit trail per run

**Done when:** A Mason edit attempt against a path that has no active workspace lease is blocked at the orchestrator level, a decision record is written explaining the block, and the Pack Board surfaces the decision log per run.

---

### v1-B — Memory Invalidation Persistence (Phase 4b completion)

**Why:** The ROADMAP header previously claimed Phase 4b was shipped. A source audit found that invalidation is computed at query time only — there is no `memory_updates` table, no `invalidated_by` column on memory records, and no `GET /api/memory/updates` endpoint. The StreamingQA adapter cannot score belief-update accuracy against a persistence layer that does not exist.

**What to build:**

- `memory_updates` table in `src/db.rs`: `(update_id, old_memory_id, new_memory_id, reason, created_at)`
- `invalidated_by: Option<String>` on the memory record schema (references `update_id`)
- Coobie ingest pipeline: before writing a new memory entry, check for semantic near-duplicates with conflicting claims via cosine similarity on the embedding store. If found above threshold, write a supersession record and set `invalidated_by` on the old entry.
- `GET /api/memory/updates` endpoint returning supersession history
- Memory Board UI panel: distinguish invalidated entries from current entries; allow operator to confirm or reject a supersession

**Done when:** Ingesting a new fact that contradicts an older one persists a supersession record, the old entry is flagged in the DB, and `GET /api/memory/updates` returns the history. StreamingQA can then score belief-update accuracy against real persistence.

---

### v1-C — FailureKind Classification

**Why:** Mason's fix loop handles all failures identically. A wrong-answer failure (test ran, output was wrong) requires a different fix prompt than a compile error (code never ran). The ROADMAP Phase 2 spec calls this out as `FailureKind::WrongAnswer` but it was never implemented as an enum variant.

**What to build:**

- `FailureKind` enum in `src/models.rs`: `CompileError`, `TestFailure`, `WrongAnswer`, `Timeout`, `Unknown`
- Parser in the fix loop that classifies stdout/stderr: detect "expected … got …", "FAILED", "assertion failed", exit code patterns
- `WrongAnswer` variant triggers a distinct Mason prompt that includes the expected vs actual diff rather than the raw compiler error
- `failure_kind` field on `ValidationSummary` so Coobie can pattern-match on failure type in its causal records

**Done when:** A run with a wrong-answer test failure shows `failure_kind: WrongAnswer` in the run summary and Mason's fix attempt uses the diff-focused prompt.

---

### v1-D — Operator Model Minimum Viable

**Why:** The five-layer interview tables exist in the DB but have no logic. Scout's intent generation and Coobie's preflight have no connection to operator context. Without this, every new spec starts from scratch regardless of how well Coobie knows the operator's patterns.

**What to build (two-layer MVP, not the full five-layer spec):**

- PackChat `interview` command: initiates a two-layer intake (operating rhythms + recurring decisions) with checkpoint approval after each layer
- `commissioning-brief.json` artifact generated from the approved layers: contains operator's primary work patterns, preferred tools, recurring decisions, and risk tolerances
- Scout draft integration: when a `commissioning-brief.json` exists for the operator, Scout includes its top-3 patterns in the intent package prompt
- Coobie preflight integration: operator's stated risk tolerances contribute to `required_checks` and guardrail text
- Update the `operator_model_sessions` and `operator_model_layer_checkpoints` tables (schema exists; no logic is wired)

**Done when:** An operator who has completed the two-layer interview sees their stated patterns reflected in Scout's intent packages and Coobie's required checks on subsequent runs.

---

### v1 Benchmark / product gate

- Decision audit log surfaced in Pack Board per run
- Memory supersession events returned by `GET /api/memory/updates`
- At least one run showing `failure_kind: WrongAnswer` in the validation summary
- At least one run where Scout's intent package references operator model context

---

## Phase 2 — Bramble Real Test Execution

**Unlocks:** Coobie's `validation_passed` score becomes meaningful.
`TEST_BLIND_SPOT` and `PACK_BREAKDOWN` causal signals currently score against stubs.

**What to build:**

- `bramble_run_tests` in orchestrator — reads `spec.test_commands` (same detection logic as Piper) and executes them in the staged workspace
- Stdout/stderr streamed as `LiveEvent::BuildOutput` on the broadcast channel (already exists — Bramble just needs to use it)
- `ValidationSummary` populated from real exit codes and parsed test output, not from scenario results or stubs
- Bramble's phase attribution records `validation_passed: true/false` from actual runs
- Feed result back as `test_coverage_score` into the Coobie episode at ingest time
- **Mason online-judge feedback loop** — `FailureKind::WrongAnswer` (wired in Phase v1-C) feeds into Mason's fix loop with a diff-focused prompt. Phase 2 formalises the loop end-to-end: parse stdout diff output from competitive programming judges as a first-class failure signal.
- **LiveCodeBench adapter** — wrapper command that pulls recent problems, runs Mason/Piper, and emits pass/fail per problem into the benchmark runner.
- **Aider Polyglot adapter** — maps Aider's multi-language benchmark format to Harkonnen specs; no structural changes needed.

**Benchmark gate:**

- `local_regression` stays green on every merge
- the code loop should be runnable through the emerging `SWE-bench Verified` adapter, even if scores are unpublished
- `LiveCodeBench` adapter wired and producing artifacts
- `Aider Polyglot` adapter wired for a direct open-source comparison line

**Done when:** A spec with `test_commands` shows real pass/fail in the run report, Coobie's episode scores reflect actual test execution, and Mason's fix loop handles wrong-answer failures.

---

## Phase 3 — Documentation, Evaluation, and Lifecycle Benchmarks

**Operator note:** live twin provisioning is explicitly deferred for now. The
existing manifest-based twin support and `twin_fidelity_score` remain as
diagnostic telemetry, but Phase 3 completion no longer depends on Docker-backed
service virtualization unless a future product actually needs it.

### 3-A — Flint documentation phase

- After `self.package_artifacts(run_id)` in the Flint phase, call a new `flint_generate_docs` method
- `flint_generate_docs` reads the spec and Mason's implementation artifacts from the run dir, calls the Flint LLM agent to generate a `README.md` and optionally an `API.md`
- Writes output to `artifacts/docs/<run_id>/README.md` and `artifacts/docs/<run_id>/API.md`
- Adds `docs/README.md` to `blackboard.artifact_refs`
- Required for DevBench — must land in Phase 3

### 3-B — `src/spec_adherence.rs` — LLM-as-judge benchmark

New builtin benchmark module (follows the same pattern as `cladder.rs`).

- Loads a JSONL file where each line is `{ "run_id": "...", "spec_path": "...", "output_path": "..." }`, OR if no dataset is provided, queries the local SQLite DB for the last N completed runs
- For each entry: reads the spec's `acceptance_criteria` list and Mason's primary output artifact, asks an LLM judge to score each criterion as met/partial/unmet
- Metrics: `completeness` (fraction of criteria met or partial), `precision` (fraction fully met)
- Env: `SPEC_ADHERENCE_DATASET`, `SPEC_ADHERENCE_LIMIT`, `SPEC_ADHERENCE_OUTPUT`, `SPEC_ADHERENCE_MIN_COMPLETENESS`
- Builtin name: `"spec_adherence"`
- Also supports a `without_scout` mode to measure what Scout's formalization step contributes

### 3-C — `src/scenario_delta.rs` — Hidden Scenario Delta benchmark

New builtin benchmark module — Harkonnen-native, no external dataset.

- Queries `coobie_episode_scores` in the local SQLite DB for runs where both `validation_passed` and `scenario_passed` are recorded
- Computes: `visible_pass_rate` (fraction where `validation_passed = 1`), `hidden_pass_rate` (fraction where `scenario_passed = 1`), `delta = visible_pass_rate - hidden_pass_rate`
- A large positive delta means Bramble passes things that Sable catches — proves the hidden scenario value
- Writes `scenario_delta_report.md` and `scenario_delta_summary.json` to artifact dir
- Builtin name: `"scenario_delta"`
- Env: `SCENARIO_DELTA_LIMIT` (max runs to include), `SCENARIO_DELTA_OUTPUT`

### 3-D — `src/twin_fidelity.rs` — Optional twin telemetry benchmark

- Keep `twin_fidelity_score` honest by counting only services whose status is `"running"`
- Retain a Harkonnen-native summary suite for historical comparison and future revisit
- Do not treat this as a Phase 3 blocker while twin provisioning is deferred

### 3-E — `suites.yaml` entries

- `harkonnen_spec_adherence` — Spec Adherence Rate (harkonnen-native, builtin: `spec_adherence`)
- `harkonnen_scenario_delta` — Hidden Scenario Delta (harkonnen-native, builtin: `scenario_delta`)
- `harkonnen_twin_fidelity` — Twin Fidelity telemetry (harkonnen-native, builtin: `twin_fidelity`)
- `harkonnen_devbench` — DevBench wrapper suite (script-based external adapter)

### 3-F — DevBench adapter wiring

- Add `scripts/benchmark-devbench.sh` following the same skip-and-delegate pattern as the existing SWE-bench and tau2 wrappers
- `DEVBENCH_COMMAND` supplies the exact local or hosted command that runs Harkonnen on DevBench
- Optional `DEVBENCH_ROOT` points at the benchmark checkout or adapter workspace
- The wrapper exits with skip code `10` when DevBench is not configured so Phase 3 can be wired before the full external harness is installed

**Benchmark gate:**

- `spec_adherence` first run published — completeness and precision against local run corpus
- `scenario_delta` first run published — visible vs hidden pass rate gap across recent runs
- `DevBench` adapter wired (script-based, not builtin)

**Done when:** Flint produces a doc artifact per run, `spec_adherence` and
`scenario_delta` have first-run baselines, and the DevBench adapter is wired so
local or hosted runs can be launched through the benchmark manifest. Live twin
provisioning is intentionally out of scope until a product needs it.

---

## Phase 4b — Memory Invalidation and Fact-Update Tracking

**Status: Partially shipped.** Query-time invalidation reasons exist and are surfaced in retrieval hits. The persistence layer (supersession records, `memory_updates` table, `GET /api/memory/updates`) is being completed in Phase v1-B above. This entry is the benchmark and maintenance reference point once v1-B lands.

**What was built in Phase 1 (query-time only):**

- `invalidation_reasons` field on `MemoryRetrievalHit` — computed at retrieval time from `superseded_by` / `challenged_by` provenance fields
- `memory_invalidation_reasons()` helper in orchestrator surfaces reasons per hit

**What v1-B completes (persistence layer):**

- `memory_updates` table in SQLite: `(update_id, old_memory_id, new_memory_id, reason, created_at)`
- `invalidated_by` on memory records, set at ingest time when a near-duplicate conflict is detected
- `GET /api/memory/updates` endpoint
- Memory Board UI panel: invalidated entries distinguished from current entries
- **StreamingQA native adapter** — streams fact-update events to Coobie's memory, then queries whether the updated belief is correctly recalled. Scores belief-update accuracy separately from static recall.

**Benchmark gate:**

- `StreamingQA` first run published — belief-update accuracy, no competitor publishes this
- re-run `LongMemEval` to confirm invalidation tracking does not regress static recall

**Done when:** Ingesting a new fact that contradicts an older one marks the old fact as invalidated in the DB, the operator can review the supersession, and StreamingQA has a baseline score.

---

## Phase 5b — Memory Infrastructure (Qdrant + OCR)

**Unlocks:** Semantic recall at scale and document ingest completeness. The SQLite vector store is sufficient for current run volume, but it becomes the bottleneck as the memory corpus grows.

**What to build:**

- **Qdrant integration** — add `src/coobie/qdrant.rs` implementing the semantic index over extracted text and memory summaries. Payload metadata: `org`, `role`, `product`, `spec_id`, `run_id`, `agent`, `memory_type`, `tags`, `created_at`. Qdrant replaces the SQLite vector store for long-term semantic memory (keep SQLite as the short-term and episodic store). Bootstrap script at `scripts/bootstrap-coobie-memory-stack.sh` already exists.
- **OCR pipeline** — add Tesseract-backed OCR for scanned PDFs and images. Current extractors handle text-forward formats but cannot read scanned documents. Wire through the existing `memory ingest` path: detect image-only PDFs, invoke `tesseract`, write extracted text sidecar alongside the imported asset.
- **Memory module refactor** — split the growing `src/memory.rs` into the module tree described in COOBIE_SPEC: `src/memory/mod.rs`, `working.rs`, `episodic.rs`, `semantic.rs`, `causal.rs`, `consolidation.rs`, `blackboard.rs`, `retrieval.rs`, `extraction.rs`. No behavior change; this is a maintainability gate before the codebase grows further.

**Benchmark gate:**

- re-run `FRAMES` after Qdrant lands to confirm multi-hop recall improves over the SQLite vector baseline
- `LongMemEval` and `LoCoMo` re-run to confirm semantic recall quality does not regress

**Done when:** Qdrant is serving semantic queries for long-term memory, OCR-scanned PDFs can be ingested, and `src/memory.rs` is split into the COOBIE_SPEC module tree.

---

## Phase 6 — TypeDB Semantic Layer (Layer C)

**Unlocks:** Typed causal queries that vector similarity cannot answer. "Find all runs where TWIN_GAP caused a failure that was fixed by an intervention that held for ≥ 3 runs" requires a graph, not a similarity score.

TypeDB 3.x changes the implementation assumptions: the old JVM burden objection is gone because TypeDB's core is now Rust. It is still an external service with real operational cost, so it stays later in the sequence and should not replace SQLite as the hot path. When this phase opens, use the Rust-based TypeDB 3.x line in a container-first deployment and avoid the legacy Java server/distribution entirely.

**What to build:**

- TypeDB 3.x instance configured in the home-linux setup TOML
- `src/coobie/semantic.rs` implementing the `SemanticMemory` trait from COOBIE_SPEC
- Rust-facing TypeDB adapter using the official TypeDB 3.x driver behind the `SemanticMemory` abstraction
- TypeDB schema from COOBIE_SPEC: entities (agent, goal, episode, observation, action, outcome, artifact, lesson, failure-mode, causal-link), relations as specified
- TypeDB 3.x function-backed semantic reasoning; do not design around legacy rules-engine assumptions
- Write-back: after Phase 5 consolidation approval, promoted lessons and causal links written to TypeDB as well as the file store
- Query surface: `POST /api/coobie/query` routes natural-language causal questions through Coobie's retrieval chain
- Coobie's briefing builder calls TypeDB for cross-run pattern queries before preflight
- **GAIA Level 3 adapter** — maps GAIA's multi-step tool-use tasks to Harkonnen's factory run format; routes sub-tasks to the appropriate Labrador rather than a single generalist. Requires the TypeDB query surface to be live.
- **AgentBench adapters** — OS, database, and web environments, each mapped to a Labrador role.

**Benchmark gate:**

- cross-run causal-query benchmarks comparing SQL aggregate recall versus TypeDB-backed semantic recall
- `GAIA Level 3` first run published
- `AgentBench` first runs across OS, DB, and web environments

**Done when:** You can ask Coobie "what caused the last three failures on this spec" and get an answer from a typed graph; GAIA Level 3 and AgentBench adapters wired and producing artifacts.

---

## Phase 7 — Causal Attribution Corpus and E-CARE

**Unlocks:** The strongest publishable internal benchmark claims. The causal attribution corpus and E-CARE adapter are both spec'd in Phase 5 but can be built incrementally and do not depend on TypeDB.

**What to build:**

- **Causal attribution accuracy corpus** — 30–50 labeled runs with seeded failures (wrong API version, missing env var, breaking schema change, etc.). Each entry has a spec, a seeded failure, a ground-truth cause label, and the Coobie `diagnose` output. Score top-1 and top-3 accuracy. Start with 10 entries for a first baseline. Lives in `factory/benchmarks/causal-attribution/`.
- **E-CARE native adapter** — maps Coobie's `diagnose` output to E-CARE's evaluation format and scores whether generated causal explanations are judged natural-language coherent. Run after consolidation so promoted lessons can inform subsequent diagnose output.
- Publish before/after comparisons for causal attribution accuracy: pre-Phase 4 (pure semantic recall) versus post-Phase 4 (causal graph-augmented).

**Benchmark gate:**

- `E-CARE` first run published — causal explanation coherence score
- `causal attribution accuracy` first run published — top-1 / top-3 vs semantic-only baseline

**Done when:** The corpus has at least 30 labeled entries, the causal attribution accuracy benchmark has a published run, and E-CARE has a published score.

---

## Phase 8 — The Calvin Archive And Governed Integration

**Unlocks:** A persisted intelligence layer that does not merely remember, but
decides what becomes part of itself. This is the phase where Harkonnen moves
from identity continuity as a typed graph to identity continuity as a governed
integration process.

The design for this phase — including the formal metrics and the three-tier data
stack — is specified in [the-soul-of-ai/08-Identity-Continuity.md](the-soul-of-ai/08-Identity-Continuity.md)
and the integration-governance design in [the-soul-of-ai/07-Governed-Integration.md](the-soul-of-ai/07-Governed-Integration.md).

**What to build:**

**Storage layer (three-tier):**

- **TimescaleDB hypertable bootstrap** — episodic behavioral telemetry store for agent events, drift samples, stress accumulation, and SSA snapshots. Hypertable compression policy (7-day chunks, 30-day retention window). Provides the time-series foundation for D* estimation and stress computation.
- **TypeDB Calvin Archive schema** — typed ontological layer for the six chambers (Mythos, Episteme, Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Praxis), integration candidates, quarantine entries, revision graphs, and causal patterns. Schema spec in MASTER_SPEC Part 5.
- **Materialize streaming SQL views** — real-time `D*` drift monitoring (sliding window over TimescaleDB events via SUBSCRIBE), live Meta-Governor alert views, and SSA tracking views. `D*` and SSA are the two primary continuous signals; Φ and F are computed on-demand.

**Governance and integration:**

- Calvin Archive Meta-Governor with explicit `accept`, `modify`, `reject`, and `quarantine` outcomes for identity-relevant integration events
- File-first soul package projection with `soul.json`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STYLE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md`, generated from and checked against canonical continuity state
- Integrity-hash verification and heartbeat audits so the projected soul package cannot drift silently away from the Calvin Archive
- Explicit continuity contract: `SOUL.md` declares the identity kernel; the Calvin Archive proves its continuity through experience, revision, and quarantine history
- Quarantine ledger: unresolved items persist with pending evidence conditions, salience decay, and re-evaluation triggers
- Pattern-level reflection over compressed cross-episode structures so schema revision is distinct from ordinary belief revision
- Stress-estimator computation (backed by TimescaleDB) so recurring unresolved strain triggers governed reflection instead of ad hoc self-rewrite
- Slow-loop integration-policy revision flow, more conservative than ordinary updates and naturally attachable to human endorsement
- Cross-layer hysteresis measurement so rollback quality is judged by residual behavioral drift, not only by restored file contents
- Presence continuity checks so model/provider swaps preserve identity semantics rather than resetting the pack by accident
- Pathology detection for trauma-analog overweighting, denial, fragmentation, and hyper-local overfitting

**Metrics implementation (from chapter 07):**

- **`D*` (Drift Bound)** — `D* = α/γ`, where α is behavioral deviation rate (from episodic log) and γ is recovery rate (from consolidation events). Materialize view watches `D*` continuously; Meta-Governor triggered if session drift exceeds bound.
- **SSA (Semantic Soul Alignment)** — cross-domain weighted action-pattern consistency against Labrador persona goals. Computed per run window and stored as a TimescaleDB event.
- **F (Variational Free Energy)** — KL divergence between agent's generative model and actual observations; high F signals that the agent must seek clarification or update beliefs. Computed on-demand, not streamed.
- **Φ (Integrated Information)** — bipartition-minimized causal integration measure over the Calvin Archive graph. Used to gate Calvin Archive updates: a post-learning drop in Φ triggers quarantine rather than direct integration.

**Benchmark gate:**

- D* (unjustified-drift score) published — continuous via Materialize view
- SSA baseline score published — per-run, stored in TimescaleDB
- healthy quarantine-rate / resolution-rate baseline published
- schema-revision stability benchmark published
- stress / hysteresis recovery benchmark published
- Φ post-learning drop detection wired (quarantine trigger, not yet a published score)

**Done when:** Harkonnen can distinguish accepted, rejected, modified, and quarantined identity changes; the projected soul package is verifiable against canonical continuity state; D* and SSA are instrumented and streaming; reflection can revise schemas without overwriting raw experience; rollback quality is measured through hysteresis rather than assumed; and policy-level revision is slower, more conservative, and explicitly reviewable.

---

## Parallel Product Track — Calvin Archive Visualizer

**Why this is a prerequisite for Phase 8 debuggability:** The Calvin Archive is a six-chamber typed graph with revision history, quarantine ledger, causal links, and continuous D*/SSA signals. Without a visual surface, failures in integration governance are invisible — you cannot tell whether a quarantine is growing pathologically, whether a chamber is fragmenting, or whether D* drift is localised to one persona axis. The Pack Board's current flat list views cannot represent this structure. If you cannot see the archive, you cannot debug it.

**Reference approach:** [pascalorg/editor](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor) demonstrates the right architectural pattern: a React Three Fiber + Three.js + WebGPU stack rendering a navigable spatial graph where structural regions (levels, in their case) map to distinct visual zones. The six Calvin Archive chambers map directly to that model — each chamber is a navigable region, memory entries are nodes, causal links are edges, quarantine items are visually flagged, and the revision graph is a traversable history layer.

**What to build:**

- **Chamber map view** — six spatial zones (Mythos, Episteme, Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Praxis) rendered as distinct regions in a 3D canvas using React Three Fiber. Nodes within each chamber represent memory entries; edge thickness encodes confidence; quarantine items rendered with a distinct glyph and salience-decay color fade.
- **Causal link traversal** — click a node to expand its inbound/outbound causal links. Link labels show `PearlHierarchyLevel` (Associational / Interventional / Counterfactual). Paths that contributed to a quarantine are highlighted.
- **Revision history rail** — a time-axis rail alongside the chamber map showing integration events (accept / modify / reject / quarantine) as stamped markers. Scrubbing the rail replays chamber state at that point in time using snapshots from TypeDB.
- **Live D\* and SSA overlay** — Materialize SUBSCRIBE feed drives a real-time drift indicator per chamber. Chambers approaching the D\* bound shift color; an alert badge appears when the Meta-Governor fires.
- **Quarantine ledger panel** — side panel listing open quarantine items with pending evidence conditions, salience decay progress, and a one-click "resolve / promote / dismiss" action that calls the Meta-Governor API.
- **PackChat integration** — `@coobie what is in Ethos right now?` routes to a chamber query that highlights matching nodes in the visualizer. The visualizer and PackChat share a run context so Coobie's answers can be spatially anchored.

**Technology notes:**

- React Three Fiber + Three.js is the right rendering layer — WebGPU acceleration optional but worth targeting for large archives.
- Zustand for local visualizer state (selected node, active chamber, time cursor). The archive data itself comes from `GET /api/coobie/query` and the TypeDB query surface from Phase 6.
- The visualizer can be developed independently of the full Calvin Archive backend: stub the data layer with the existing SQLite memory entries and causal links (Phase 4) so the UI can be built and tested before Phase 8 ships.
- Ship as a new Pack Board tab ("Archive") rather than a standalone app — it shares the same auth surface and avoids a separate deployment.

**Dependency:** TypeDB query surface (Phase 6) required for chamber queries and revision history. D*/SSA live overlay requires Materialize (Phase 8). The stub-data path (SQLite causal links) can be used to develop the chamber map and traversal views before those phases land.

**Done when:** An operator can open the Archive tab, navigate the six chambers, click through causal links, scrub the revision history rail, see live D* drift per chamber, and resolve a quarantine item without opening a database client.

---

## Parallel Product Track — Operator Model Activation

**Unlocks:** Better commissioning, fewer mid-run clarification failures, and a reusable operator context layer that Scout, Coobie, and Keeper can all consume.

**Current state:** DB schema is complete (`operator_model_profiles`, `operator_model_sessions`, `operator_model_layer_checkpoints`, `operator_model_entries`, `operator_model_exports`, `operator_model_update_candidates` tables all exist). No interview logic, no layer progression, no artifact generation, no Scout/Coobie integration is wired. Phase v1-D ships the two-layer MVP. The full five-layer spec follows.

**Full five-layer spec (post-v1):**

- Native PackChat-based elicitation workflow with five fixed layers: operating rhythms, recurring decisions, dependencies, institutional knowledge, friction
- Approval checkpoints after each layer, reusing the existing checkpoint and unblock flow
- Artifact generation for `operating-model.json`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `schedule-recommendations.json`, plus a Harkonnen-specific `commissioning-brief.json`
- Scout draft integration so spec generation can use an approved operator model as first-class context
- Coobie preflight integration so operator-model assumptions contribute to `required_checks`, guardrails, and escalation rules

**Current shipped slice:** project-first operator-model resolution now influences Scout draft generation and Coobie preflight guidance. The remaining product work is the checkpoint/export/review loop that turns the interview into durable stamped artifacts with operator approval.

- Review loop after runs: consolidation can propose operator-model updates, which the operator can keep/discard/edit before promotion
- Import/export compatibility with OB1-style operating artifacts, but no direct code dependency on OB1

**Benchmark / product gate:**

- Measurable drop in open checkpoints per run for projects using an approved operator model
- Spec draft quality and spec adherence compared with and without the operator model

**Done when:** A user can complete the five-layer interview with approvals, generate operating artifacts, and see those artifacts materially influence Scout draft quality and Coobie preflight behavior.

---

## Parallel Product Track — External Integrations

**Unlocks:** The factory becomes observable and controllable from outside the Pack Board. Without outbound notifications, every run outcome requires a human to poll the UI. Without inbound triggers, specs must be started manually. Without auth, the API is open to anyone on the network.

This is a usability prerequisite for any team or multi-machine deployment. Most items are small and independent; they do not need to ship as a block.

### EI-1 — API Authentication

**Why first:** The HTTP API is currently unauthenticated. Every other integration that touches the API needs auth to be safe.

- API key authentication middleware in `src/api.rs` — bearer token checked on all non-health routes
- `api_keys` table in SQLite: `(key_id, key_hash, label, created_at, last_used_at, revoked)`
- `POST /api/auth/keys` (create), `GET /api/auth/keys` (list), `DELETE /api/auth/keys/:id` (revoke)
- `GET /health` and the SSE stream remain unauthenticated (monitoring and browser clients)
- CLI flag `--api-key` or env var `HARKONNEN_API_KEY` for local development bypass

### EI-2 — Outbound Webhook Notifications

**Why:** A webhook system is the foundation for all other integrations (Slack, Discord, GitHub). Everything downstream subscribes to the same event stream.

- `webhooks` table: `(webhook_id, url, secret, events: JSON array, created_at, enabled)`
- `POST /api/webhooks`, `GET /api/webhooks`, `DELETE /api/webhooks/:id`
- Events emitted: `run.started`, `run.completed`, `run.failed`, `checkpoint.created`, `checkpoint.resolved`, `metric_attack.detected`, `consolidation.ready`
- Payload: `{ event, run_id, spec_id, timestamp, summary, pack_board_url }`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature on the `X-Harkonnen-Signature` header (same pattern as GitHub webhooks)
- Retry with exponential backoff on 5xx or connection failure (up to 3 attempts)

### EI-3 — Slack Integration

**Why:** Operators spend time in Slack. Run outcomes, checkpoints, and Coobie insights need to surface where the operator already is, not require switching to the Pack Board.

**Outbound (Slack notifies operator):**

- Rich block-kit messages on `run.completed`: summary card with pass/fail, agent trace count, cost, decision count, link to Pack Board
- Checkpoint alert with inline Approve / Reject buttons that call back to the Harkonnen API
- `metric_attack.detected` alert: which metric was attacked, which exploit fired, suggested mitigation
- `run.failed` with Coobie's top causal diagnosis (from the latest `diagnose` output)

**Inbound (operator controls factory from Slack):**

- Slash command `/harkonnen run <spec-id>` — triggers a run, responds with run ID and Pack Board link
- `/harkonnen status <run-id>` — returns current phase and latest event
- `/harkonnen ask <question>` — routes to Coobie's `dispatch_message` as a PackChat message
- `/harkonnen checkpoint approve <id>` / `reject <id>` — resolves checkpoints without opening the browser

**Config:** Slack app credentials stored in setup TOML under `[integrations.slack]`. Webhook URL and bot token. No hardcoded values.

### EI-4 — Discord Integration

**Why:** Discord is common in solo operator and small-team contexts (and is where local AI communities live). The surface area is simpler than Slack and the bot API is lower-friction to self-host.

**Outbound:**

- Webhook embeds for `run.completed`, `checkpoint.created`, `run.failed` — same content as Slack but using Discord embed format (color-coded by outcome)
- Thread-per-run option: create a Discord thread for the run and post phase updates as the run progresses

**Inbound (bot commands in a designated channel):**

- `!run <spec-id>` — triggers run
- `!status <run-id>` — current phase and last event
- `!approve <checkpoint-id>` / `!reject <checkpoint-id>`
- `!ask <question>` — routes to Coobie

**Config:** `[integrations.discord]` in setup TOML. Bot token and guild/channel IDs.

### EI-5 — GitHub Integration

**Why:** Mason already creates branches (`mason/<spec-id>-<run-id>`). The natural next step is auto-creating a PR from that branch, posting results as a PR comment, and allowing a GitHub webhook to trigger a spec run on push or PR open.

**Outbound:**

- After a run completes with Mason edits applied: optionally create a PR from the Mason branch using the GitHub API. PR body includes the spec title, run ID, decision log summary, Coobie critique outcome, and Pack Board link.
- Post a run summary as a PR comment when a run is triggered by a PR webhook (see inbound). Comment includes pass/fail, cost, and the top advisory concern from Coobie.

**Inbound:**

- `POST /api/integrations/github/webhook` receives GitHub webhook events
- On `push` to a configured branch: trigger a spec run for any spec whose `code_under_test` paths overlap the changed files
- On `pull_request.opened` or `pull_request.synchronize`: trigger the relevant spec run and post result as a PR comment
- Webhook secret verified via HMAC (same pattern as EI-2)

**Config:** `[integrations.github]` in setup TOML. Personal access token or GitHub App credentials. Repo and branch filter.

### EI-6 — Run Scheduling

**Why:** Regression suites, memory benchmarks, and recurring spec sweeps should not require manual triggering.

- `scheduled_runs` table: `(schedule_id, spec_id, cron_expression, enabled, last_run_at, next_run_at)`
- `POST /api/schedules`, `GET /api/schedules`, `PUT /api/schedules/:id`, `DELETE /api/schedules/:id`
- Cron evaluator runs on a background tokio task; fires `POST /api/runs` when the schedule triggers
- Pack Board schedule manager panel: add/edit/disable schedules, see last run outcome

### EI-7 — Cost Budget Enforcement

**Why:** A misconfigured spec or an infinite fix loop can consume unbounded tokens. There is currently no hard stop mechanism.

- `max_cost_usd: Option<f64>` on `RunRequest` and in spec YAML
- After each LLM call, `get_run_cost_summary` checks accumulated cost against the budget. If exceeded: abort the current phase gracefully, write a `budget_exceeded` blocker to the blackboard, send a `run.failed` event with reason `budget_exceeded`
- `cost_hard_cap_usd` global config in setup TOML as a safety ceiling above any per-run budget
- Pack Board run overview shows budget consumed vs limit as a progress bar

### EI-8 — Health and Operational Endpoints

**Why:** Basic operational hygiene for any hosted or multi-machine deployment.

**Shipped (2026-04-20):**

- `GET /health` — probes DB (`SELECT 1`) and `memory/index.json`; returns `{ status, version, uptime_secs, db_ok, memory_index_ok }`. Responds `503` if DB probe fails. `AppContext.started_at` tracks server boot time.
- `GET /api/status` — returns `{ active_runs, agent_claim_count, memory_entry_count, last_benchmark_run }`. All queries fail-soft. `last_benchmark_run` returns `null` until the `benchmark_runs` table exists (wired for Phase 2+). Authentication deferred to EI-1.

**Remaining:**

- CORS configuration in setup TOML: `[server.cors]` with `allowed_origins` list, defaulting to `localhost` only
- Structured JSON logging option (for log aggregators): `[server.logging] format = "json"` in setup TOML
- Wire `GET /api/status` behind EI-1 auth (viewer role and above)

## Parallel Product Track — Hosted And Team Integrations

**Context:** Harkonnen should be usable beyond the Pack Board and local CLI.
This track formalizes the bridge from the local-first factory into external
control planes, workflow tools, shared knowledge systems, and chat surfaces
without hard-coding any one vendor or employer.

The architecture is: Harkonnen exposes itself **as an MCP server** first. That
lets Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, workflow tools, and any other
MCP-capable client consume factory operations through one protocol instead of
bespoke per-client integrations. For clients that cannot yet consume MCP
directly, Harkonnen can expose a narrower connector or OpenAPI surface on top.

This is independent of the consumer EI track. EI-1 (auth) should land first
because every hosted or shared surface needs it.

---

### ENT-1 — Harkonnen as an MCP Server

**Why first:** MCP is the integration primitive. Once Harkonnen exposes itself
as an MCP server, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, workflow tools, and any
other MCP-capable client can consume factory operations without bespoke
connectors. This is the foundation for ENT-2 onward.

**What to build:**

- `src/mcp_server.rs` — implements the MCP server protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio or SSE transport). The MCP spec has a Rust SDK (`rmcp` crate); use that rather than writing the transport layer by hand.
- **Resources** (read-only, queryable by clients):
  - `harkonnen://runs` — list of recent runs with status
  - `harkonnen://runs/{run_id}` — full run detail including traces, decisions, optimization program, metric attacks
  - `harkonnen://memory/lessons` — promoted lessons from the consolidation workbench
  - `harkonnen://memory/causal` — recent causal patterns Coobie has identified
  - `harkonnen://specs` — available specs for commissioning
- **Tools** (callable actions):
  - `run_spec(spec_id, options)` — triggers a factory run, returns run_id
  - `get_run_status(run_id)` — current phase + latest event
  - `resolve_checkpoint(checkpoint_id, decision, note)` — approve or reject a checkpoint from any MCP client
  - `ask_coobie(question, context)` — routes to Coobie's `dispatch_message`, returns the response
  - `ingest_memory(content, source, tags)` — pushes a document or note into Coobie's memory ingest pipeline
  - `list_decisions(run_id)` — returns the decision audit log for a run
- **Prompts** (parameterized prompt templates for external clients):
  - `briefing_for_spec(spec_id)` — pre-built Coobie briefing prompt
  - `diagnose_run(run_id)` — causal diagnosis prompt for a completed run
- MCP server transport registered in setup TOML under `[mcp.self]` — enables it when the flag is set:

```toml
[mcp.self]
enabled = true
transport = "sse"          # "stdio" for Claude Desktop / VS Code; "sse" for hosted clients
port = 3001                # separate port from the main HTTP API
auth_required = true       # reuses EI-1 API key
```

- CLI command `harkonnen mcp serve` starts the MCP server as a standalone process alongside the main server

**Done when:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or VS Code can list factory runs,
trigger a run, and ask Coobie a question via MCP tool calls. An SSE-capable
hosted client can discover the same server and invoke the same tools.

---

### ENT-2 — External Connector Surface

**Why:** Some external tools can call OpenAPI connectors or workflow actions
but cannot yet consume MCP directly. A thin connector layer backed by the
Harkonnen REST API provides the same operational capability without forcing
bespoke logic into the core factory.

**What to build:**

- `factory/connectors/harkonnen-openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3.0 spec covering the key Harkonnen endpoints: `POST /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs/:id`, `GET /api/runs/:id/traces`, `GET /api/runs/:id/decisions`, `POST /api/chat/threads/:id/messages`, `POST /api/coordination/checkpoints/:id/reply`
- `factory/connectors/manifest.yaml` — connector manifest with display names, descriptions, and action categories for external workflow tools
- `factory/connectors/workflow-templates/` — starter workflow templates:
  - `run-spec.yaml` — triggers a factory run from a natural-language request, polls status, posts outcome
  - `ask-coobie.yaml` — routes a question to Coobie and surfaces the answer with run context
  - `checkpoint-review.yaml` — presents pending checkpoints and handles approve/reject inline in the conversation
- Authentication: OAuth2 client credentials flow using the generic OIDC path from ENT-3. The connector authenticates as a service principal, not as the individual user.
- Documentation at `factory/connectors/README.md`: step-by-step setup for importing the connector into an external workflow or agent platform.

**Done when:** An external workflow client can trigger a Harkonnen run, ask
Coobie a question, and approve a checkpoint from a chat or automation surface
without touching the Pack Board.

---

### ENT-3 — OIDC Authentication

**Why:** API keys are convenient for local development, but shared and hosted
deployments need a standard identity plane. A generic OIDC/JWT path keeps the
core server vendor-neutral while still supporting hosted clients, bots, and
workflow tools.

**What to build:**

- OAuth2/OIDC JWT validation middleware in `src/api.rs` — alongside the existing API key path. Either an API key **or** a valid OIDC JWT is accepted on protected routes.
- `[auth.oidc]` section in setup TOML:

```toml
[auth.oidc]
enabled = true
issuer = "OIDC_ISSUER_URL"
client_id = "OIDC_CLIENT_ID"
audience  = "harkonnen-factory"
```

- JWT validation: fetch JWKS from the configured issuer, validate signature, `aud`, `iss`, and expiry. Use the `jsonwebtoken` crate.
- Role claims: map OIDC app roles or scopes to Harkonnen roles — `Harkonnen.Operator` (full access), `Harkonnen.Viewer` (read-only), `Harkonnen.Agent` (service principal / automation)
- `GET /api/auth/me` — returns the authenticated identity and resolved role for debugging

**Done when:** An external connector authenticating as an OIDC service
principal can call the Harkonnen API without an API key, and a viewer-role
principal cannot trigger runs or approve checkpoints.

---

### ENT-4 — Knowledge Base Ingest

**Why:** The value of Coobie's memory is proportional to what's in it. In many
real deployments, the authoritative knowledge lives in shared drives, wikis,
document libraries, or hosted knowledge systems rather than in files you can
paste into the terminal. Connectors make that knowledge available to Coobie
without manual re-entry.

**What to build:**

- `src/integrations/knowledge.rs` — generic knowledge-source client layer with provider adapters for document systems and hosted search APIs
- CLI commands such as:
  - `harkonnen memory ingest --source docs --collection <collection-id>`
  - `harkonnen memory ingest --source wiki --space <space-id>`
  - `harkonnen memory ingest --source search --query "<search terms>"`
- Incremental sync state table so repeated runs fetch only changed or added documents
- `[integrations.knowledge]` section in setup TOML:

```toml
[integrations.knowledge]
enabled = true
provider = "generic"
client_id = "KNOWLEDGE_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret_env = "KNOWLEDGE_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

- Bidirectional write-back (deferred to v2): after consolidation promotes a lesson, optionally write a summary back to a designated knowledge sink as a structured item. Operators can review and approve write-back separately from promoting within Harkonnen.

**Done when:** Running a knowledge-source ingest adds shared documents into
Coobie's retrievable memory, and subsequent runs against related specs can cite
those documents in the briefing.

---

### ENT-5 — ChatOps Integration

**Why:** Many teams want checkpoint approvals, notifications, and lightweight
questions to flow through chat surfaces rather than only through the Pack
Board. The integration should support at least one rich-card surface and one
plain webhook or bot surface.

**Outbound (chat surface notifies operator):**

- Rich-card message on `run.completed`: outcome badge, agent trace count, cost, decision count, Coobie's top advisory concern, Pack Board button.
- Checkpoint notification as an actionable card or message component — the operator can click Approve or Reject directly in chat. The callback goes to `POST /api/coordination/checkpoints/:id/reply` using the ENT-3 principal.
- `run.failed` card with Coobie's causal diagnosis summary and a "Diagnose in Coobie" deep link into PackChat.
- `metric_attack.detected` card: exploit description, detection signal, suggested mitigation, link to `GET /api/runs/:id/metric-attacks`.

**Inbound (bot commands):**

- Bot or slash-command surface with commands such as:
  - `@Harkonnen run <spec-id>` — triggers run, replies with run ID card
  - `@Harkonnen status <run-id>` — current phase + last event
  - `@Harkonnen ask <question>` — routes to Coobie, replies with the response as a card
  - `@Harkonnen checkpoints` — lists open checkpoints for the current operator
- Bot can be scoped to a specific room or channel or allowed more broadly.

**Config:** `[integrations.chatops]` in setup TOML:

```toml
[integrations.chatops]
enabled = true
provider = "generic"
incoming_webhook_url_env = "CHATOPS_WEBHOOK_URL"
bot_app_id_env           = "CHATOPS_BOT_APP_ID"
bot_app_password_env     = "CHATOPS_BOT_PASSWORD"
checkpoint_callback_base = "https://harkonnen.example/api"
```

**Done when:** A completed run posts a rich message to the configured chat
surface, a checkpoint can be approved from chat without opening the Pack Board,
and `@Harkonnen ask` routes to Coobie.

---

### ENT-6 — Clone-Local Profile And Hosted Deployment Hardening

**Why:** Local machine profiles are useful operationally, but they are
clone-local and should not become part of the canonical repo state. This phase
hardens setup generation, self-hosted deployment config, and validation so
public clones stay clean while still supporting richer local environments.

**What to build:**

- Keep generated machine profiles under `setups/machines/` and out of Git by default
- Add optional `[auth.oidc]`, `[integrations.chatops]`, `[integrations.knowledge]`, and `[mcp.self]` blocks to generated profiles when the setup interview selects them
- Add `[mcp.self]` support with `transport = "sse"` for hosted clients
- `cargo run -- setup check` extended to validate selected integrations and MCP self-server startup for the active local profile

**Done when:** Running `cargo run -- setup check` on a locally generated
profile reports green for the selected integrations, and a second machine can
be provisioned from the same public templates without inheriting private state.

---

## Benchmark Track (cross-phase)

Benchmarks should advance in lockstep with implementation phases. When a phase ships, at least one benchmark gate tied to it should ship too.

### Phase-aligned milestones summary

| Phase | Key benchmarks unlocked |
| --- | --- |
| v1 | Decision audit completeness, memory supersession accuracy, WrongAnswer classification rate |
| Phase 2 | SWE-bench Verified readiness, LiveCodeBench, Aider Polyglot |
| Phase 3 | spec adherence rate, hidden scenario delta, DevBench, coordination-compression / downstream-validation time, optional twin telemetry |
| Phase 4b | StreamingQA belief-update accuracy |
| Phase 5b | FRAMES re-run (Qdrant), LongMemEval / LoCoMo regression check |
| Phase 6 | GAIA Level 3, AgentBench |
| Phase 7 | E-CARE, causal attribution accuracy |
| Phase 8 | unjustified drift, quarantine resolution quality, schema revision stability, stress / hysteresis recovery quality |

### Always-on benchmarks

- `Local Regression Gate` — hard merge gate, runs on every substantial change
- `LongMemEval` paired mode (Coobie vs raw LLM) — run on every memory-relevant change
- `LoCoMo QA` paired mode — longer-horizon memory regression check

### Competitive positioning benchmarks

#### vs Mem0 / MindPalace / Zep

- `FRAMES` — multi-hop factual recall; Mem0 publishes here. Native adapter live. Requires Phase 5b Qdrant for best results.
- `StreamingQA` — belief-update accuracy; no competitor tracks this. Phase 4b.
- `HELMET` — retrieval precision/recall. Native adapter live.
- `LongMemEval` — long-term assistant memory. Native adapter live.
- `LoCoMo QA` — long-horizon dialogue memory. Native adapter live.

#### vs OpenCode / Aider / single-agent coding tools

- `LiveCodeBench` — recent competitive programming problems; contamination-resistant. Phase 2.
- `Aider Polyglot` — Aider's own multi-language leaderboard. Phase 2.
- `DevBench` — full software lifecycle; structural argument against single-phase tools. Phase 3.
- `SWE-bench Verified` / `SWE-bench Pro` — industry-standard code loop benchmarks. Phase 2.

#### vs general agent frameworks

- `GAIA Level 3` — multi-step delegation; single-agent tools fail here. Phase 6.
- `AgentBench` — eight environments; tests Labrador role separation. Phase 6.

#### Causal reasoning — unique claim, no competitor benchmarks this

- `CLADDER` — Pearl hierarchy accuracy. Native adapter live.
- `E-CARE` — causal explanation coherence. Phase 7.

#### Harkonnen-native — cannot be run by any competitor

- `Spec Adherence Rate` — completeness and precision vs spec. Phase 3.
- `Hidden Scenario Delta` — visible vs hidden pass rate gap. Phase 3.
- `Causal Attribution Accuracy` — seeded failure corpus, top-1 / top-3. Phase 7.

### Reporting standard

Every reportable benchmark claim should include:

- the raw-LLM baseline on the same provider when meaningful
- the Harkonnen setup name and routing
- the benchmark split or slice used
- the commit hash and benchmark artifact path
- latency and cost where available, not just accuracy

---

## Tracking

Each active implementation phase gets its own git branch: `phase/v1-guardrails`, `phase/2-bramble-tests`, `phase/3-ash-twins`, etc.
A phase is merged to `main` when its "Done when" condition is verifiably met.
This file is updated when a phase ships — move it from the numbered list above into the "already done" section.

Benchmark wiring should advance in lockstep with implementation:

- when a phase ships, add or tighten at least one benchmark gate tied to it
- when a public benchmark is still adapter-only, capture that explicitly here rather than implying it is fully integrated
- benchmark artifacts belong in `factory/artifacts/benchmarks/` and should be linked from release notes once they support a public claim
