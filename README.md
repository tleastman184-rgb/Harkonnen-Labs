# Harkonnen Labs

## A Local-First, Causally-Aware AI Software Factory (WIP)

Harkonnen Labs is a **multi-agent software execution system** that transforms specifications into validated software artifacts while accumulating **structured operational knowledge** across runs.

At its core, Harkonnen is designed to solve a specific failure mode in modern LLM systems:

> LLM pipelines are *stateless, similarity-driven, and non-causal* — they cannot reliably improve from experience.

Harkonnen introduces a **stateful, causally-informed execution model** where:

* **Agents** perform bounded roles in a production pipeline
* **Memory** persists across runs with explicit structure
* **Causal reasoning** separates correlation from intervention
* **Policy** governs what actions are allowed, not just what is possible

The result is a system that does not just generate software — it **learns how to produce better software over time**.

---

## Conceptual Model

Harkonnen operates as a **closed-loop software factory**:

```text
Specification
   ↓
Multi-Agent Execution
   ↓
Validation (including hidden scenarios)
   ↓
Artifact Production
   ↓
Memory Ingestion (episodic)
   ↓
Consolidation → Semantic + Causal Knowledge
   ↓
Improved Future Execution
```

This loop converts **execution traces into reusable knowledge**.

---

## System Components

### 1. Agent Pack (Execution Layer)

Harkonnen decomposes execution into nine specialist agents:

| Agent | Role | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scout** | Spec retriever | Parses specs, flags ambiguity, produces normalized intent packages |
| **Mason** | Build retriever | Generates and modifies code; iterates up to 3 times on build failure with structured fix-loop reasoning |
| **Piper** | Tool retriever | Runs build tools, fetches docs, executes helpers with live stdout/stderr streaming |
| **Bramble** | Test retriever | Generates visible tests, runs lint and build, feeds pass/fail into Coobie scoring |
| **Sable** | Scenario retriever | Executes hidden behavioral scenarios; its results are the ground truth, not Bramble's |
| **Ash** | Twin retriever | Provisions digital twin manifests and dependency stubs for safe external-system simulation |
| **Flint** | Artifact retriever | Collects outputs, packages artifact bundles for inspection and evidence |
| **Coobie** | Memory retriever | Manages layered memory — episodic capture, causal reasoning, Palace patrol, and consolidation |
| **Keeper** | Boundary retriever | Enforces policy, guards role boundaries, owns file-claim coordination |

This is not a monolithic agent — it is a **role-constrained system with explicit handoffs**.
Scout, Sable, and Keeper are pinned to Claude. All others route per setup configuration.

---

### 2. Coobie (Layered Memory System)

Coobie implements a **multi-layer memory architecture** that goes beyond a flat note store:

| Layer | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Working Memory | Current run state (compressed, ephemeral, token-budgeted) | Live |
| Episodic Memory | Ordered execution traces (state → action → result) with phase attribution | Live |
| Semantic Memory | Stable facts, patterns, invariants — hybrid vector + keyword retrieval | Live |
| Causal Memory | Intervention-aware cause/effect relationships scored per run | Live |
| Team Blackboard | Shared agent coordination state across four named slices | Live |
| Consolidation | Promotion, pruning, and abstraction with operator-reviewed keep/discard/edit flow | Live |

#### Coobie Palace

The Palace is a **spatially-organized compound recall layer** built on top of Coobie's causal memory. Related failure causes are grouped into named **Dens** that Coobie patrols before every run:

| Den | Residents | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec Den | `SPEC_AMBIGUITY`, `BROAD_SCOPE` | Failures from unclear or over-scoped specs |
| Test Den | `TEST_BLIND_SPOT` | Visible tests passed but hidden scenarios caught failures |
| Twin Den | `TWIN_GAP` | Simulated environment didn't match production |
| Pack Den | `PACK_BREAKDOWN` | Degraded or incomplete Labrador phase execution |
| Memory Den | `NO_PRIOR_MEMORY` | Factory ran cold with no relevant prior context |

A **Patrol** walks each den before a run, computing a compound **Scent** — when multiple causes from the same den have fired together, the whole den is elevated, not just the individual signal. Results inject directly into the preflight briefing's `required_checks`, `guardrails`, and `open_questions`. The principle: *the whole den smells, not just one corner*.

#### Causal Reasoning

Coobie tracks three levels of the causal hierarchy:

* **Association** — co-occurrence patterns across runs
* **Intervention** — outcome changes due to explicit actions, recorded in the causal link table
* **Counterfactuals** — inferred alternative outcomes

Live features:

* Causal streaks — a cause that fires repeatedly across runs is escalated in the preflight briefing
* Cross-run pattern detection — identifies causes that cluster on specific spec types or phases
* Phase 3 preflight guidance — spec-scoped cause history drives `required_checks` before each run
* Palace compound recall — den-level streak weight elevates compound failures beyond individual cause scores
* Cross-phase causal graph — episode-to-episode links record `phase_sequence` and `failure_triggered` relationships
* Pearl hierarchy labels — Coobie hypotheses and causal graph edges are tagged associational, interventional, or counterfactual
* Multi-hop retrieval chain — query responses now trace hop-by-hop memory retrieval depth and supporting evidence
* Memory invalidation / fact-update tracking — superseded facts are surfaced as stale rather than silently overwritten
* Causal feedback loop — Sable's scenario rationale is written back to project memory as evidence

---

### 3. PackChat — Conversational Control Plane

PackChat shifts the factory from pure autonomous orchestration to **supervised autonomy** — you stay in the loop through the same conversation surface while the pack works.

* **Chat threads** scoped to a run or spec, persisted in SQLite
* **`@mention` routing** — `@coobie what did we learn?`, `@mason explain the fix` — dispatches to the right Labrador with its full system role loaded
* **Blocking checkpoint flow** — when an agent needs an answer before proceeding, it surfaces a structured reply card in the thread; you answer there, the run continues
* **Unblock flow** — `POST /api/agents/:id/unblock` releases a stalled run after you reply
* **Default to Coobie** for unaddressed messages — memory and context retrieval without `@mention`

---

### 4. Persistence Model

* **SQLite** → episodic memory, run state, chat threads, phase attributions, causal links
* **Filesystem** → specs, artifacts, evidence, Coobie memory (`factory/memory/*.md`)
* **fastembed / OpenAI-compatible embeddings + SQLite vector store** → hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval (live)
* **(Planned / Optional) TypeDB 3.x service** → durable semantic graph + typed relational queries, not the hot-path store
* **(Future) Causal graph / causaloids** → executable causal reasoning via DeepCausality

---

### 5. Benchmarking And Improvement Loop

Harkonnen now includes a first-class benchmark toolchain so changes can be measured, compared, and regressed automatically.

Core entrypoints:

```bash
cargo run -- benchmark list
cargo run -- benchmark run
cargo run -- benchmark run --suite local_regression --strict
cargo run -- benchmark run --all
./scripts/run-benchmarks.sh
```

The machine-readable suite manifest lives at `factory/benchmarks/suites.yaml`, benchmark strategy and reporting guidance live in `MASTER_SPEC.md` (Part 6), and reports are written to `factory/artifacts/benchmarks/`. The default suite is a local regression gate, and LongMemEval, LoCoMo, FRAMES, StreamingQA, HELMET, and CLADDER now run through native Harkonnen adapters alongside raw-LLM or direct baselines where supported. The execution roadmap in `ROADMAP.md` treats benchmark gates as phase-level exit criteria rather than optional follow-up work.

The OpenAI/Codex provider path also supports optional OpenAI-compatible BYO endpoints through a setup `base_url`, so benchmark runs can target local or third-party compatible backends without changing Rust code.

### Benchmark Results

Status legend: **wired** = adapter integrated and runnable; **planned** = adapter not yet built; **internal** = Harkonnen-native, no external suite.

### 6. Execution Semantics

Each run produces:

1. **Artifacts** (code, configs, outputs)
2. **Episodes** (what happened)
3. **Evaluations** (did it work?)
4. **Memory updates** (what should be remembered)

Over time:

> The system transitions from *prompt-driven behavior* to *memory-informed behavior*.

## Project-Level Memory

Each project can maintain isolated memory:

```text
.harkonnen/
  project-memory/
  evidence/
```

This enables:

* per-repo learning
* reuse of patterns
* isolation across domains

---

## Example Memory Evolution

### Episode

```json
{
  "action": "retry with schema validation",
  "result": "success",
  "context": {
    "language": "rust"
  }
}
```

---

### Semantic Fact

```json
{
  "fact": "schema validation improves structured outputs",
  "confidence": 0.81
}
```

---

### Causal Claim

```json
{
  "claim": "disabling schema validation reduces latency but increases failure rate",
  "confidence": 0.74
}
```

---

## Execution Loop

```text
Spec → Agents → Validation → Artifacts → Memory → Consolidation → Better Next Run
```

---

## Design Principles

* **Local-first** — no required cloud dependency
* **Inspectable** — every decision traceable
* **Composable** — agents are modular
* **Causal over statistical** — prefer explanation over similarity
* **Memory is first-class** — not an afterthought

---

## 🚀 Direction

Near-term:

* **Phase 2** — Bramble real test execution so `validation_passed` and coverage-style signals are grounded in actual test runs
* **Phase 3** — Ash live twin provisioning plus Flint documentation artifacts for richer hidden-scenario and DevBench evaluation
* **Operator Model full five-layer interview** — extend the MVP (v1-D) to cover dependencies, institutional knowledge, and friction layers; generate the full artifact set (`USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `operating-model.json`)

Mid-term:

* **Phase 5b** — Qdrant-backed long-term semantic memory, OCR ingest, and memory-module refactor
* **Phase 6** — TypeDB 3.x semantic graph for typed causal queries, GAIA Level 3, and AgentBench
* **DeepCausality Phase 2** — real causaloids derived from the causal link table once the semantic layer is live

Long-term:

* **Phase 7** — E-CARE, causal attribution corpus, and stronger publishable causal benchmark claims
* **Phase 8 — Soul Store** — typed autobiographical, epistemic, ethical, and behavioral continuity store for persisted agent identities. Six chambers (Mythos, Episteme, Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Praxis) backed by TypeDB. See [MASTER_SPEC.md](MASTER_SPEC.md) Part 5 and [What-Is-An-AI-Soul.md](the-soul-of-ai/What-Is-An-AI-Soul.md) for the full design.
* **Self-improving software factory** — each run makes the next run better, operator models stamp every commissioned repo, and Soul Store gives each Labrador a persistent identity that evolves without drifting
