# Harkonnen Labs Architecture

Harkonnen Labs is a local-first, spec-driven AI software factory. Humans define intent, judge outcomes, and evolve the system. Agents perform the implementation work inside a constrained, observable factory.

This document is the conceptual north star for the MVP scaffold in this repository and the next layers we build on top of it.

## Current implementation snapshot

The current build is no longer just a bare scaffold. Today Harkonnen includes:

- core and project-local Coobie memory with a durable split between `factory/memory/` and `<repo>/.harkonnen/project-memory/`
- extracted document and URL ingest for PDFs, text files, office docs, HTML, and websites
- repo-local continuity artifacts such as `project-scan`, `resume-packet`, `strategy-register`, `memory-status`, and `stale-memory-history`
- a residue-style exploration log and dead-end registry
- stale-memory severity scoring plus mitigation planning and outcome tracking
- a bounded retriever-themed inner forge with plan review, execution reports, and hook artifacts

The architecture below still describes the target model, but these capabilities are already live in the current repo.

## What Harkonnen Labs Is

Harkonnen Labs is not a chatbot, not just an IDE assistant, and not a thin wrapper around code generation. It is a factory system with a clear separation between the factory itself and the product it builds.

The system is centered on these ideas:

- humans define intent
- agents perform implementation
- correctness is judged by behavioral outcomes
- the factory stays separate from the product
- the system accumulates memory over time
- hidden scenarios matter more than visible tests

The long-term goal is a Level 5 software factory where the center of gravity shifts away from handwritten implementation and toward stronger specifications, better evaluation, safer autonomy, and reusable engineering memory.

## Why Harkonnen Labs Should Exist

Most AI coding workflows make local moments faster while making the overall system messier. The usual failure modes are familiar:

- more half-right code
- more review burden
- more context switching
- more hidden errors
- more false confidence

Harkonnen Labs exists to replace that workflow rather than decorate it.

### The Problems It Solves

#### 1. Implementation is no longer the main bottleneck

As coding gets cheaper, intent quality and evaluation quality matter more. The factory should optimize for:

- precise intent
- strong specs
- strong evaluation
- strong memory
- controlled autonomy

#### 2. Human code review does not scale in a dark factory

If agents generate large amounts of code quickly, traditional diff review becomes the bottleneck. The factory therefore needs:

- hidden behavioral scenarios
- evidence-based acceptance
- artifact bundles
- optional code inspection instead of mandatory inspection

#### 3. AI tools get dangerous when they wander

Without role separation, agents step on each other. The factory needs:

- named specialist agents
- strict permissions
- tool boundaries
- policy enforcement

#### 4. Organizations lose knowledge constantly

Specs, mistakes, architecture decisions, and workarounds disappear into chat logs and people. The factory needs:

- local memory
- retrieval
- pattern reuse
- failure memory
- decision capture

#### 5. Trust collapses when the system is invisible

A real factory should feel inspectable and legible. The factory needs:

- observable execution
- visible run state
- visible agent behavior
- visible artifact flow
- visible scenario outcomes

## Core Design Principles

- Spec-first development: bad output usually starts with weak specs, not weak coding.
- Outcome-based judgment: acceptance should be driven by evidence, not vibes.
- Local-first operation: state, logs, specs, scenarios, and artifacts should be owned locally.
- Role separation: agents should have explicit jobs and bounded powers.
- Boundary enforcement: factory, product, memory, twin, and hidden scenarios must remain distinct.
- Compound learning: each run should make future runs better.
- Human authority: humans define goals and make acceptance decisions.

## System Components

### 1. Specification Intake Layer

Purpose: load, validate, normalize, and trace human-written specs.

Why it matters: this is the true front door of the factory.

Responsibilities:

- load YAML or Markdown specs
- validate required fields
- normalize into an intent package
- flag ambiguity
- assign run IDs and metadata
- preserve traceability from spec to artifact bundle

Current repo mapping:

- [src/spec.rs](./src/spec.rs)
- [src/models.rs](./src/models.rs)
- [src/cli.rs](./src/cli.rs)

### 2. Orchestrator

Purpose: coordinate every run, phase, and agent handoff.

Why it matters: without orchestration, there is no factory, only a loose pile of tools.

Responsibilities:

- create jobs
- assign phases
- invoke agents in sequence
- pass context packages
- track state transitions
- capture logs and outputs
- handle retries and failures
- prevent role violations

Current repo mapping:

- [src/orchestrator.rs](./src/orchestrator.rs)
- [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs)

### 3. Agent Role System

Purpose: define named specialist agents with constrained responsibilities, tools, and boundaries.

Why it matters: specialist agents are easier to reason about, observe, and constrain than general-purpose autonomous workers.

Current repo mapping:

- [factory/agents/profiles/scout.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/scout.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/mason.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/mason.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/piper.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/piper.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/bramble.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/bramble.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/sable.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/sable.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/ash.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/ash.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/flint.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/flint.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/coobie.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/coobie.yaml)
- [factory/agents/profiles/keeper.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/keeper.yaml)
- [factory/agents/personality/labrador.md](./factory/agents/personality/labrador.md)

#### Agent Pack

##### Scout

Role: spec retriever.

Responsibilities:

- parse specs
- identify ambiguity
- produce normalized intent packages

##### Mason

Role: build retriever.

Responsibilities:

- generate code
- modify code
- implement multi-file changes

##### Piper

Role: tool retriever.

Responsibilities:

- run tools
- fetch docs
- execute build helpers

##### Bramble

Role: test retriever.

Responsibilities:

- generate visible tests
- run lint
- run build
- run internal validation loops

##### Sable

Role: scenario retriever.

Responsibilities:

- execute hidden scenarios
- compare behavior
- produce evaluation reports

##### Ash

Role: twin retriever.

Responsibilities:

- provision twins
- mock dependencies
- prepare test environments

##### Flint

Role: artifact retriever.

Responsibilities:

- collect outputs
- package bundles
- summarize artifacts

##### Coobie

Role: memory retriever.

Responsibilities:

- retrieve prior specs
- retrieve patterns
- retrieve failures
- store new knowledge

##### Keeper

Role: boundary retriever.

Responsibilities:

- enforce policy
- prevent unsafe actions
- protect secrets
- maintain factory-product separation

### 4. Memory System

Purpose: store and retrieve local knowledge that compounds over time.

Why it matters: a factory that forgets everything pays the same intelligence tax on every run.

What it should store:

- prior specs
- prior outcomes
- decisions
- failures
- implementation patterns
- architecture notes
- scenario lessons
- product-specific known constraints

#### Coobie Memory Layers

Coobie should manage three distinct layers instead of one undifferentiated note pile:

- short-term memory: current run state, recent tool outputs, current plan, and active team context
- long-term memory: durable notes, imported assets, run reflections, and reusable patterns
- team memory: shared pack state, handoffs, claims, blockers, and run board status

Recommended local stack:

- filesystem is the source of truth for durable memory
- SQLite holds structured run state and early team memory
- repo-local `.harkonnen/` state carries project-specific continuity when Harkonnen works on an external codebase
- Qdrant is the optional semantic index for long-term memory
- Redis is optional hot memory for shared coordination, not the canonical record
- AnythingLLM remains an optional local retrieval accelerator

Current repo mapping:

- [src/memory.rs](./src/memory.rs)
- [src/orchestrator.rs](./src/orchestrator.rs)
- [factory/agents/profiles/coobie.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/coobie.yaml)
- [COOBIE.md](./COOBIE.md)
- [factory/memory](./factory/memory)
- project-local `<repo>/.harkonnen/project-memory/` on external codebases

### 5. Hidden Scenario System

Purpose: protect the true behavioral acceptance criteria from implementation agents.

Why it matters: if the build agent can see the exam, it will optimize for the exam.

Responsibilities:

- store hidden behavioral scenarios outside the implementation workspace
- isolate scenario access to Sable and Keeper
- produce clear pass/fail evidence
- preserve hidden truth while still exposing useful diagnostics

Current repo status: implemented via protected scenario files and run-state evaluation, with room for richer black-box behavioral scenarios.

### 6. Digital Twin Environment

Purpose: simulate external systems safely.

Why it matters: autonomous work against live systems is either fake, dangerous, or both.

What it should include:

- mocked APIs
- fake auth or token services
- fixture-backed databases
- queue or event simulators when relevant
- stable endpoints for integration evaluation

Current repo status: partial. The current system builds safe twin manifests, dependency stubs, and optional twin narratives, but not full external-system provisioning.

### 7. Internal Validation Layer

Purpose: provide fast local signals before scenario evaluation.

Why it matters: hidden scenarios are the truth, but fast visible validation is still useful.

Responsibilities:

- compile
- lint
- run visible tests
- capture stdout and stderr
- retry with structured feedback where appropriate

Current repo status: partial through the CLI and Rust build path.

### 8. Artifact Packaging Layer

Purpose: gather the outputs of a run into one inspectable acceptance bundle.

Why it matters: humans in a Level 5 system judge outcomes, so those outcomes need to be easy to inspect.

Bundle contents should include:

- spec used
- summary of what changed
- internal validation report
- hidden scenario report
- logs
- build outputs
- release candidate files
- acceptance status

Current repo mapping:

- [src/reporting.rs](./src/reporting.rs)
- [src/orchestrator.rs](./src/orchestrator.rs)

### 9. Policy Engine

Purpose: enforce path boundaries, command boundaries, permissions, and role separation.

Why it matters: safety must be built into the architecture.

Responsibilities:

- workspace-scoped writes
- no hidden scenario access outside approved roles
- no unrestricted shell execution
- no secret access outside approved boundaries
- no product-factory contamination
- no destructive actions without approval

Current repo mapping:

- [src/policy.rs](./src/policy.rs)
- [factory/agents/profiles/keeper.yaml](./factory/agents/profiles/keeper.yaml)

### 10. Product Workspace Manager

Purpose: create isolated workspaces for each run.

Why it matters: runs should be reproducible, separable, and disposable.

Responsibilities:

- create per-run workspaces
- copy or mount target products
- attach logs and artifacts
- isolate outputs from one another

Current repo mapping:

- [src/workspace.rs](./src/workspace.rs)
- [factory/workspaces](./factory/workspaces) when runs are created

### 11. CLI

Purpose: provide the first usable control surface for the factory.

Why it matters: the CLI is the fastest path to a working factory spine.

Current commands:

- `spec validate`
- `run start`
- `run status`
- `run report`
- `artifact package`
- `memory index`
- `memory search`
- `memory import`
- `setup check`
- `setup init`
- `setup claude-pack`
- `serve`

Current repo mapping:

- [src/cli.rs](./src/cli.rs)

### 12. Web UI / Operations View

Purpose: make the factory observable and trustworthy through a live operations dashboard.

Why it matters: if the system is invisible, people will default back to manual code inspection.

The UI should shift trust from handwritten diff review to:

- process visibility
- behavioral evidence
- role accountability
- scenario results
- artifact summaries

Current repo status: implemented as a React/Vite Pack Board with API-backed run detail views, with further workflow triggers still open for expansion.

## UI Concept: The Pack Board

The web UI should feel like a factory operations dashboard, not a generic admin console. It should look like a glass wall into a machine room where a coordinated pack is working a run.

### Main Regions

#### 1. Top Status Bar

Show:

- current run ID
- product name
- spec title
- current phase
- overall health
- elapsed time
- last updated timestamp

#### 2. Agent Panel Grid

Each agent gets a card showing:

- Labrador icon or illustration
- agent name
- role title
- current state
- current task summary
- latest log line
- progress indicator
- output or artifact count
- warning or error badge when needed

#### 3. Run Timeline

Show the phases of a run, such as:

- spec intake
- memory enrichment
- build
- internal validation
- twin setup
- scenario evaluation
- artifact packaging
- ready for decision

#### 4. Evidence and Artifact Drawer

Show:

- generated reports
- scenario results
- logs
- bundle contents
- summaries
- downloadable artifacts

#### 5. System Map / Boundaries View

Show:

- factory side
- product side
- scenario vault
- twin environment
- memory store

This reinforces the architecture and makes boundary violations easier to understand.

## Agent Card Design

Each card should use a distinct but stylistically consistent black-labrador motif. The UI should feel industrial but warm, operational rather than cute.

Each card should include:

### Header

- dog icon
- agent name
- role subtitle

### Body

- current action
- run phase
- tools in use
- last completed step
- input and output summary

### Footer

- status chip: idle, running, blocked, failed, or complete
- elapsed task time
- view logs action

## Labrador Icon Concepts

- Scout: satchel or rolled spec tube
- Mason: blueprint, wrench, or hard-hat motif
- Piper: utility harness or toolkit tag
- Bramble: goggles or checkmark motif
- Sable: sentinel posture with shield or clipboard
- Ash: terrain lines, cubes, or network nodes
- Flint: parcel, bundle, or document canister
- Coobie: archive box, tag, or buried-bone map motif
- Keeper: gate, shield, or key iconography

## Recommended UI Components

### Global Components

- `RunHeader`
- `PhaseTimeline`
- `HealthStatusBar`
- `ArtifactDrawer`
- `SystemBoundaryMap`

### Agent Components

- `AgentGrid`
- `AgentCard`
- `AgentDetailDrawer`
- `AgentLogPanel`
- `AgentToolUsagePanel`

### Evaluation Components

- `ScenarioSummaryPanel`
- `ValidationSummaryPanel`
- `EvidenceViewer`
- `AcceptanceDecisionPanel`

### Knowledge Components

- `MemoryHitsPanel`
- `RetrievedPatternsPanel`
- `PriorFailuresPanel`

### Ops Components

- `TwinStatusPanel`
- `PolicyEventsPanel`
- `WorkspaceStatusPanel`

## Suggested Visual Language

The Pack Board should feel:

- industrial but warm
- operational, not cute
- muted or dark-toned
- card-based and inspectable
- iconographically consistent
- readable at a glance

Think control room for an AI machine shop, not pet-adoption website with logs.

## Delivery Priorities

### Phase 1

- run header
- agent grid
- status chips
- log panel
- phase timeline

### Phase 2

- artifact drawer
- scenario summary
- memory hits
- policy events

### Phase 3

- system map
- twin status
- richer per-agent visual state
- run comparison history

## MVP Spine in This Repository

The current scaffold already establishes the factory spine:

- spec loading and validation
- run creation and persistence in SQLite
- per-run workspace creation
- artifact packaging
- local memory placeholder
- policy boundary placeholder
- agent profile definitions
- CLI entry points

The next practical layers to build are:

1. richer spec validation and intent normalization
2. explicit phase state machine in the orchestrator
3. agent execution adapters and logs
4. hidden scenario isolation
5. twin provisioning
6. richer memory indexing and retrieval
7. a Pack Board web UI
