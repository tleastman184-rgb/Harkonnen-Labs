# Coobie Solitaire-for-Agents Roadmap

Purpose: make memory retrieval self-correcting so the most useful project and core memories arrive in context before work begins.

Priority items:
- Keep product-local memory in the repo under `.harkonnen/project-memory/` and retain only cross-project learnings in Harkonnen core memory.
- Track which memory entries were loaded, recalled, and associated with successful or failed runs.
- Rank retrieval by demonstrated usefulness rather than keyword match alone.
- Preload likely-relevant project memory, core memory, prior dead ends, and proven success patterns before planning begins.
- Capture lightweight agent-behavior lessons when a role repeatedly over-plans, under-validates, or skips evidence.
- Distinguish worker-session memory from Coobie memory: resumable harness state is short-horizon convenience, while Coobie remains the durable causal source of truth.
- Implemented foundation: hierarchical repo-local context and scoped skill bundles are now discovered under `.harkonnen/`, cited by Coobie, and attached to the worker harness before execution.
- Feed prior mitigation outcomes back into memory ranking so revalidated memories earn trust and unresolved memories are surfaced with stronger caution.

Expected outcome:
- Coobie becomes a practical long-memory Labrador for the pack: concise, anticipatory, increasingly better at surfacing the right lessons before the run drifts, and careful about what belongs to worker convenience versus durable factory truth.
